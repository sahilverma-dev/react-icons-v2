# React Icons v2

Hi there! üëã I'm Sahil Verma, and this is the repository for React Icons v2, a website aimed at providing a modern and visually appealing experience for users interested in React Icons.

## About

The motivation behind building this site was to offer a fresh and updated look compared to the official React Icons website. I found the official site lacking in terms of aesthetics and modern design principles, so I decided to create a new and improved version.

For the development of this website, I chose Next.js for its server-side rendering capabilities, Tailwind CSS for a utility-first styling approach, Shandn for a sleek design, and, of course, react-icons to showcase a wide variety of icons.

**Please note:** This is not the official [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) website, and I do not own the [React Icons repository](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/). All credits for the fantastic React Icons library go to the original creators and contributors.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the collection of React Icons on this website!
